The city of Bristol has a long and colourful history, closely associated with the sea. This is still very much in evidence in the docks and quays that reach right into the centre of the city. Away from the main shopping area there are many beautiful buildings and fascinating clues to Bristol's grand past. The perfect area to explore on a Treasure Hunt!
