Windsor town is dominated by the majestic Windsor Castle, one of the great royal residences of Britain. It is also a charming town to visit, with a cluster of interesting shops and enticing cafes and plenty of easily overlooked details hinting at the royal connection. What's more, a short walk over the River Thames is the town of Eton, home to one of the most famous old schools in the world. This Treasure Hunt draws both of these towns together in a fascinating walk through history.
