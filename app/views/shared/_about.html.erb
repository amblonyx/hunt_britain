			<p>Treasure Hunt Britain was formed in 2011. 
			We aim to provide fun Treasure Hunts giving everyone the opportunity to explore our favourite places in the UK, in a more interesting way than using a guidebook.
			</p>
			<p>The idea grew out of something we have always enjoyed. 
			Over the last fifteen years we have created Treasure Hunts for each other all around the UK, visiting almost every county. 
			We love exploring our own country, full of beautiful towns and countryside, and we love setting and solving challenges. 
			It seemed only natural to offer our Treasure Hunts to others!
			</p>

		<div class="content span5 well">
			<p>To make Treasure Hunts that anyone can enjoy we have had to think carefully, and so we have ended up creating brand new hunts in the places that we already know and love. 
			The number of hunts will grow as we return to old haunts and plan out new Treasure Hunts suitable for anyone.</p>
			<p>We also mention places you might visit on your day out, or spots to stop for food and drink.
			Usually these are places we have been to and enjoyed ourselves, although very occasionally we've noted something recommended to us.</p>
